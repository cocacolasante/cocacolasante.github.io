                                personalized experience that cultivates a deep understanding of the organizations we partner with,

                                Our process has resulted in our
                                services being contracted annually to accommodate multiple non-profit grant cycles, which we believe
                                non-profits should never miss out on. However, we are also happy to work with clients on one-time
                                projects.
